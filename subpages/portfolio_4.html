        <p>School work: recreate a news article into something better</p>

        <p>My personal vision on the interface I have designed is that it should be as simple and intuitive as possible for the user. This means that the interface is clear and organized, allowing the user to easily scroll through the story in a user-friendly way.</p>
        <p>To apply what I have learned during my minor: Interface Design, I have chosen to turn an article from "de correspondent" into a fun visual story. I have chosen learning goals that I enjoyed doing and wanted to improve upon. So, I have made many illustrations for my article to bring the story to life because it was a poorly designed article that was suitable for design with its writing style. By experimenting with layouts and techniques, I have presented this story in a horizontal scroll, which, in my opinion, is most suitable for this article.</p>
        <p>I am very satisfied with the outcome of the process. The process was challenging, and I learned a lot about how to make illustrations within the same style (including backgrounds) and how to convey this to the reader.</p>
